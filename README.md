- Requirements:

Node & Npm installed

In order to run the server, first you must install dependencies using command ``npm install `` , after that `` npm start ``

Go to, for example: 
http://localhost:3000/top-contributors/Barcelona?top=150

For TOP, you can use [50,100,150]. TOP 50 will be considered as default.

If you want to test the app, you can do it using command ``npm test ``.
